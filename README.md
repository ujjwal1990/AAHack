Project Architecture:

I have used MVP for the application. To simplify the business logic and the client logic.

Project Tech Specs:
1. Volley network library: In this application, I have used volley library for network call purpose.
2. GSON: I have used the GSON library recommended by the Google also for json parsing.
3. Hosting the booking sample file on "myjson.com".  http://myjson.com/1has55
4. Material designs: Using Material design for the app.
5. Using Fragments: With the activities, I have also used fragments in the application to make it reuse anywhere.

Till now I have been able to complete the project architecture setup, network call data parsing and show it in the view.

My further idea to make this app more usable based on the criteria are below and I am categorizing it accordingly.

Before the travel: 
As we already have booking details for the user:

1. So we can tell the user about Weather details and based on it we can suggest users what to do in a particular time, where to stay and what activity will be best based on the location and provides them existing text and video reviews. This will engage the user to go through the app for the best experience for their trip. 

2. We can update them about the timings and if there are any changes in the schedule. 

3. Provide a way to use taxi services by integrating the existing providers to make the journey easy.

During the travel: 
1. Provided commuting services properly.
2. For arrival to hotel:  Notifying user on points if their device location is open and some nearby sightseeings are there. 
3. Suggesting users to pin the points. Or when the user is taking the pictures of any view then automatically attach the exact lat/lng of that location. Later we can show this to other users with navigate option and even for the same user it will be helpful for the next time.

After Travel
1. Asking their overall experiences, by getting their reviews. 
2. Show the location photos to the user based on the travel time which they have taken during the travel.

Thanks and regards
